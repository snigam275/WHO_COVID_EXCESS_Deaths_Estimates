# WHO_COVID_EXCESS_Deaths_Estimates
EDA on Dataset containing WHO estimates of excess mortality by country associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.A data-driven project analyzing WHO's estimates of excess COVID-19 deaths by country to assess the pandemic's true global impact.
This project aims to:
1) Analyze and visualize WHO's COVID-19 excess death estimates by country to understand pandemic impact.
2) Perform data cleaning and summarization to gain insights.
3) Visualize key trends using scatter plots, line graphs, boxplots, pie charts, and more.
4) Detect outliers and patterns in excess COVID-19 death estimates across countries using WHO data.
5) Provide a clear, visual analysis of excess COVID-19 death estimates by country to support decision-making and reporting
